# Project 0

## Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe implementation in Javascript for Project 0 in WDI 23.

To play the player choses either the **X** or **O** option in the "Who do you choose?" box.

Once the selection is made the box disappears and the tictactoe game can begin.

The first user will either appear as an 'x' or an 'o' according to the selection they made at the beginning

if 3 x's or o's are made in a diagonal, horizontal or vertical line there will be a winner

A win message will pop up and the option **play again**? pops up so that a game can be played again.

The scores are saved and displayed on the top of the screen.
